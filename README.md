# Arena Shooter

In Arena Shooter, the player controls a white square shooting various enemies in increasingly difficult waves. The player is able to upgrade stats, purchase power ups, and upgrade weapons using coins dropped from the enemies through the shop. 

Enemies have four visual indicators of stats: they have an outer ring that represents the damage upon contact, an inner ring that represents speed, a scaled size that represents health, as well as a level tag that increases all stats.

## Controls:

- WASD to move
- E, Q, X to pick up, drop, and delete weapon
- SPACE or M1 to attack
- F to open shop
- ESC to pause game
- SHIFT to use power
